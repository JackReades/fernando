## How to Use




## Contributing

There are a number of ways you can contribute:

* **Improve or correct the documentation** - All the documentation is in this `readme.md` file. If you see a mistake, or think something should be clarified or expanded upon, please [submit a pull request](https://github.com/chill117/proxy-lists/pulls/new)
* **Report a bug** - Please review [existing issues](https://github.com/chill117/proxy-lists/issues) before submitting a new one; to avoid duplicates. If you can't find an issue that relates to the bug you've found, please [create a new one](https://github.com/chill117/proxy-lists/issues).
* **Request a feature** - Again, please review the [existing issues](https://github.com/chill117/proxy-lists/issues) before posting a feature request. If you can't find an existing one that covers your feature idea, please [create a new one](https://github.com/chill117/proxy-lists/issues).
* **Fix a bug** - Have a look at the [existing issues](https://github.com/chill117/proxy-lists/issues) for the project. If there's a bug in there that you'd like to tackle, please feel free to do so. I would ask that when fixing a bug, that you first create a failing test that proves the bug. Then to fix the bug, make the test pass. This should hopefully ensure that the bug never creeps into the project again. After you've done all that, you can [submit a pull request](https://github.com/chill117/proxy-lists/pulls/new) with your changes.

Before you contribute code, please read through at least some of the source code for the project. I would appreciate it if any pull requests for source code changes follow the coding style of the rest of the project.

Now if you're still interested, you'll need to get your local environment configured.
